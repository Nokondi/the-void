# the-void

Two things I've learned since I was first diagnosed with anxiety 15 years ago are that: 1) coping with anxiety is a constant practice, and 2) we are not alone. The NIH estimates that almost 1/3 of adults in the US suffer from some anxiety disorder; in spite of this, it's easy to feel isolated and unable to share your feelings with other people because you don't want to burden them.

One of the strategies I've developed to help me cope with anxiety is to scream. I find the practice cathartic. My primary outlet for this over the last decade has been as the vocalist for a metal band, where I can channel my anxiety into art for other people and can see through my audience's response that I'm not alone. Not everyone has an outlet like this, which has led me to create The Void (https://lnkd.in/gy_4Z_nJ), a web app that invites us to scream out our feelings and share them anonymously with others.

I will be continuing to develop The Void and have a few new features planned for the coming months, so please stay tuned. Also, share this with anyone you think will find it meaningful, useful, or fun. In the meantime, take care of yourselves and each other.
